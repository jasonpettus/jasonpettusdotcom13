<p>From 1989 to 1994 I was a photography major at the University of Missouri, and in the years since I have managed to scan in several hundred of my old black-and-white prints from those days. However, it's been since 2002 that I last updated the "slideshow" code at this site for viewing those photos, which makes the entire thing clunky and bug-ridden, so I have taken down this entire section until I have a chance to write more contemporary JavaScript-based slideshow code for displaying them. Check back here at a later date for more.</p>
